	<h3>Short-term targets</h3>
<p>We have set short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, in step with society. These targets are measured using the <span style="color: red"> Net Carbon Footprint metric and methodology</span></p>
<p><strong>We have set short-term carbon intensity targets each year for the following three-year periods:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>by 2-3% by 2021</li>
	<li>by 3-4% by 2022</li>
	<li>by 6-8% by 2023</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We also have medium- and long-term carbon intensity targets:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>by 20% by 2030</li>
	<li>by 45% by 2035*</li>
	<li>by 100% by 2050*</li>
</ul>

<p class="small">* Our 2035 and 2050 targets also take account of any action taken by customers.</p>
