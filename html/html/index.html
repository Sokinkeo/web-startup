<p> With this target, we will contribute to a net-zero world, where society stops adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases emissions (GHGs) in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>This supports the more ambitious goal to tackle climate change laid out in the Paris Agreement: to limit the rise in average global temperature to 1.5Â°Celsius.</p>
<p>Becoming a <i><b>net-zero emissions</b></i> energy business means that we are reducing emissions from our operations, and from the fuels and other energy products we sell to our customers. It also means capturing and storing any remaining emissions using technology or balancing them with offsets.
</p>
<p>We are transforming our business to meet our target, providing more low-carbon energy such as charging for electric vehicles, hydrogen and electricity generated by solar and wind power.</p>
<p>We are also working with our customers as they make changes, including in sectors that are difficult to decarbonize, such as aviation, shipping, road freight and industry.</p>
